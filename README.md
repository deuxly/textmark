# Textmark
### rich text to markdown
### [https://textmark.js.org](https://textmark.js.org/) 

I was always fascinated with the looks and feel of markdown format. It's so simple and minimalistic but would always have issues writing perfect markdown. So I wrote textmark to do it. Essentially you have a rich text editor for text input. Corresponding markdown for it appears on the right. Simply copy the markdown in you `.md` files. An Editor for all your markdown needs.
